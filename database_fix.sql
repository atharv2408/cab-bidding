-- Database Fix for Cab Bidding System
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix issues

-- First, check if the tables exist and fix any missing columns

-- Fix the bookings table to match what the application expects
ALTER TABLE bookings 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS selected_driver_id UUID REFERENCES drivers(id);

-- Add missing trigger to update updated_at column for bookings if not exists
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$

    RETURN NEW;
END;

-- Add trigger for bookings table if it doesn't exist
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_bookings_updated_at ON bookings;
CREATE TRIGGER update_bookings_updated_at

    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Fix the users table issue by checking if email query works properly
-- Add an index on email for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- For the 406 error on users table, let's fix the RLS policies
-- Drop existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own data" ON users;

-- Re-enable RLS

-- For the bookings table 400 error, let's check the column names
-- The error suggests there might be a "columns" parameter issue

-- Make sure we have the right columns in bookings table
-- Add any missing columns that the application expects
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS user_id UUID;
