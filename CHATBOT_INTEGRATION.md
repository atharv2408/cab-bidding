## Architecture

### Components Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Chatbot.js          # Main chatbot React component
│   └── Chatbot.css         # Chatbot styling
├── utils/
│   └── chatbotService.js   # OpenRouter API service
└── App.js                  # Updated to include chatbot
```

### Integration Points
- **Customer App**: Integrated in main customer interface (`src/App.js`)
- **Driver App**: Integrated in driver portal (`src/DriverApp.js`)
- **Environment**: API key stored in `.env` file

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
The chatbot is configured via environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
# OpenRouter API Configuration
REACT_APP_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
```

### 2. API Configuration
- **Service**: OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai/)
- **Model**: Configurable (currently set to `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- **Max Tokens**: 500 per response
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity

### 3. Fallback Responses
The chatbot includes predefined responses for common questions:

- "How do I book a ride?"
- "How does the bidding system work?"
- "How do I become a driver?"
- "What are the payment methods?"
- "How do I track my ride?"

## Usage

### For Users
1. Look for the chat bubble (💬) in the bottom-right corner
2. Click to open the chat interface
3. Type questions or click quick response buttons
4. Receive instant AI-powered or fallback responses

### For Developers
```javascript
// Import the chatbot component
import Chatbot from './components/Chatbot';

// Use in your React component
<Chatbot userType="customer" /> // or "driver"
```

## Testing

### Automated Testing
Run the integration test suite:
```bash
node test_chatbot_integration.js
```

This tests:
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3001

3. Test scenarios:
   - Click the chat bubble
   - Try quick response buttons
   - Ask custom questions
   - Test both customer and driver modes

### AI Behavior
Update `src/utils/chatbotService.js` to customize:
- System messages for different contexts
- Fallback response patterns
- API model selection
- Response processing

### Quick Responses
Modify the `getQuickResponses()` method to add/change quick response options.

## Performance Optimization

### 🚀 Optimizations Implemented
- Lazy loading of chat interface
- Conversation history limiting (last 10 messages)
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- CSS animations for smooth UX

### 📱 Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized for mobile browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Chatbot Not Appearing
