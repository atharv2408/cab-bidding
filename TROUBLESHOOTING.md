# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common errors you might encounter when running the cab-bidding-system.

## 🔧 Console Errors Fixed

### 1. ✅ React Router Error: "No routes matched location '/cab-bidding-system'"

**Problem**: The error occurs when the `homepage` in `package.json` is set to a GitHub Pages URL, causing routing issues in local development.

**Solution**: Updated `package.json` to use `"homepage": "."` for local development.

**What was changed**:
```json
// Before (causing issues)
"homepage": "https://atharv2408.github.io/cab-bidding-system",

// After (fixed)
"homepage": ".",
```

### 2. ✅ Supabase Query Errors (400/406 Status Codes)

**Problem**: Database queries failing with 400 and 406 errors due to:
- Missing table columns
- Incorrect query parameters 
- Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues

**Solution**: Run the provided `database_fix.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor.

**Steps to fix**:
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `database_fix.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

**What the script does**:
- Adds missing columns to the `bookings` table
- Fixes RLS policies for the `users` table
- Creates sample test data for development
- Updates triggers and indexes

### 3. ✅ Booking Creation Error: "Error creating ride request"

**Problem**: The booking creation was failing because of missing database columns.

**Solution**: Updated the database service to use correct column names and added the missing `selected_driver_id` column.

**What was changed**:
- Updated `database.js` to use `selected_driver_id` instead of `driver_id` for bookings
- Fixed the booking status to be `pending` instead of `confirmed` to allow bidding
- Added proper error handling for Supabase operations

### 4. ✅ Bid Acceptance Error: "Error accepting bid"

**Problem**: The bid acceptance was failing due to incorrect column references in the database update.

**Solution**: Updated the `acceptBid` function to use the correct column names.

**What was changed**:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect column name)
driver_id: bid.driver_id || bid.id,

// After (correct column name)  
selected_driver_id: bid.driver_id || bid.id,
```
